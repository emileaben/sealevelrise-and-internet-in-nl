With ever increasing evidence of human-induced climate change, and an increasing possibility that we won't be able
to stop or reverse this before significant sea level rise occurs we need to carefully study the potential effects
this sea level rise has.

Barford et al. [1] have studied what part of the Internet infrastructure in the US would be affected by sea level rise
according to climate change models in [2]. This study did not take into account the actions that would be undertaken to
counter the effects of sea level rise, for instance building dykes and/or pumping out water more actively. This is expected
to happen especially around areas with significant population and infrastructure supporting this population.

We propose a case study for the Internet around the Amsterdam area, as this is an important populated area, combined with
being a major hub where Internet interconnection happens.

One of the oldest Internet interconnect facilities in Amsterdam, NIKHEF, has always been under sea level to begin with. 
The coordinates for NIKHEF listed in PeeringDB are 3m below sea level.
